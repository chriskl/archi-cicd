# archi-cicd

Example CI/CD pipelines for Archi.  This is just some helpful example code.  Pull requests welcome.  Let's get ArchDevOps going!

## BitBucket

* bitbucket-pipelines.yml - An example BitBucket Pipelines configuration file that generates the HTML representation of your model.  You will need to set up pipeline variables to supply the Archi version, model name, etc.  It's really just a starting point for your own build that shows you how to get Archi to render on the command line.
* Dockerfile - An example of a Docker file that lets you run the Archi HTML report on your own machine locally.  This is handy so that the environment matches the pipeline and so you don't ned X installed.
